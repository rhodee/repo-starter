# Start Script

For just about any project, start here and finish what you start.

## üç™ Using the Template

Have either [Cruft](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/#installation) or [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/installation.html) installed.
Cruft is preferred, as it will allow you to update a project when this template changes.

Then:

```sh
cruft create https://github.com/rhodee/repo-starter
OR
cookiecutter gh:rhodee/repo-starter
```

This will create a new project directory with the name you specify.

Now we have a directory called `./example-project`:

```sh
cd example-project/
[nix|nom] develop . --command=$SHELL
```
